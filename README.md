* This work presents the new exact traveling wave solutions of fourth order (1+1)-dimensional Boussinesq equation. We proposed a new exponential expansion method and applied to undertake this study. This study further shows some solitary and periodic waves graphically. The exact solutions of this equation play a vital role for describing different types of wave propagation in any varied natural instances.
* Created Simulated mathematical structure of different types built on different theories of Particle Physics using Partial Differential Equation, getting useful data, analyzing graphically and statistically those data for further analysis and visualization.
* This paper also shows that the novel exponential expansion method is easily applicable and powerful mathematical tool in the symbolic computational approach in the field of mathematical physics and engineering.

This work presents the new exact traveling wave solutions of fourth order (1+1)-
dimensional Boussinesq equation. We proposed a new exponential expansion method and 
apply to undertake this study. This study further shows some solitary and periodic waves 
graphically. This paper also shows that the novel exponential expansion method is easily 
applicable and powerful mathematical tool in the symbolic computational approach in the 
field of mathematical physics and engineering. The exact solutions of this equation play a 
vital role for describing different types of wave propagation in any varied natural instances.
